IMAGLY
This is the repository of our submission for the SDSLabs(IIT Roorkee) Syntax Error.

About
Imagly provides user a new fun way to draw and even save their work to their device. User can draw by moving his hand in air. He can also access various features like different colors, shapes, erase and clear option. We can use whiteboard with trackpad also. We also provide user an image to sketch convertor.

Features:
User friendly interface with easy to access functions and buttons.
AI virtual mouse.
Whiteboard with many user-assisting features.
Image uploading (along with image preview) option for sketch conversion.

Why is  relevant?
Imagly provides user a new fun way to draw which looks super cool.If made more efficient it can eliminate the need of stylus pen/apple pencil. Also since the user can  save  image in his device and access it anytime it can be used to present ideas, make notes or just doodling.We attempted to make an image to sketch generator which enables user to get realistic pencil sketch of any given image. This saves the energy required in making an entire sketch. Also you don't need a whole range of hb pencils.

How to start?
Clone the repo using 'git clone'.

Things we could do partially
We were able to generate a given image to sketch but we were not able to generate any given image.
We were able to write Smart Contracrt and Hashvalue but not able to deploy it.
